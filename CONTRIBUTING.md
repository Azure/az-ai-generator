## Testing

We have a handful of PyTest tests. Please run (and, if necessary update) the PyTest tests before submitting a Pull Request.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to generator-az-ai](https://github.com/dbroeglin/az-ai/pull/new/main) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include PyTest tests. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:
